## Email Template Webpage 

# What you need to know:
<p> I built this project to brush up on my webdevelopment skills starting with using HTML and CSS. </p>

<br>

<p> This webpage consists of 3 main divs to deparate the three main blocks of the webiste "sidebar, emails list and selected email view" </p>

<br> 

<p> Each group of items is wrapped in its own div, and I utilized a combination of classes and IDs to style and manage their appearance effectively using CSS. </p>
